# An SQLlite collection of snippets I created in college, which I plan to keep further up to date. You can access this database by installing snippets and replacing the snippets database located in: C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Snippets\snippets.sql with my version.

Alternatively you can use any SQLLite database manager, or you know, create your DBM own. ;)
