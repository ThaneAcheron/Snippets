# An SQLite collection of frequently used/ useful of snippets. 

An SQLlite database containing a collection of snippets I created in college. Which I plan to further keep up to date.
 
You can access this database by installing snippets http://snippets.me/download and replacing the snippets database located in: C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Snippets\snippets.sql with my version.
